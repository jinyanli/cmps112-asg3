<p>The question is always how far to go in one document. 
At this point, you know how to create classes.  You know how
to use inheritance, polymorphism, and the basic storage management
mechanisms of Smalltalk.  You've also seen a sampling
of Smalltalk's powerful classes.  The rest of this
chapter simply points out areas for further study; perhaps a
newer version of this document might cover these in further
chapters.

     <dl>
<dt><b>Viewing the Smalltalk Source Code</b><dd>Lots of experience can be gained by looking at the source code
for system methods; all of them are visible: data structure classes,
the innards of the magic that makes classes be themselves objects and
have a class, a compiler written in Smalltalk itself, the classes
that implement the Smalltalk GUI and those that wrap sockets.

     <br><dt><b>Other Ways to Collect Objects</b><dd>We've seen Array, ByteArray, Dictionary, Set, and the
various streams.  You'll want to look at the Bag,
OrderedCollection, and SortedCollection classes.  For special purposes,
you'll want to examine the CObject and CType hierarchies.

     <br><dt><b>Flow of Control</b><dd><span class="sc">gnu</span> Smalltalk has support for non-preemptive multiple threads of
execution.  The state is embodied in a Process class object;
you'll also want to look at the Semaphore and ProcessorScheduler
class.

     <br><dt><b>Smalltalk Virtual Machine</b><dd><span class="sc">gnu</span> Smalltalk is implemented as a virtual instruction
set.  By invoking <span class="sc">gnu</span> Smalltalk with the <code>-d</code> option, you can
view the byte opcodes which are generated as files on the
command line are loaded.  Similarly, running <span class="sc">gnu</span> Smalltalk
with <code>-e</code> will trace the execution of instructions in your
methods.

     <p>You can look at the <span class="sc">gnu</span> Smalltalk source to gain more information
on the instruction set.  With a few modifications, it is based
on the set described in the canonical book from two of the
original designers of Smalltalk: <i>Smalltalk-80: The Language
and its Implementation</i>, by Adele Goldberg and David Robson.

     <br><dt><b>Where to get Help</b><dd>The Usenet <tt>comp.lang.smalltalk</tt> newsgroup is read by many people
with a great deal of Smalltalk experience.  There are several
commercial Smalltalk implementations; you can buy support for
these, though it isn't cheap.  For the <span class="sc">gnu</span> Smalltalk system in
particular, you can try the mailing list at:
     <pre class="example">             <a href="mailto:help-smalltalk@gnu.org">help-smalltalk@gnu.org</a>
     </pre>
     <p>No guarantees, but the subscribers will surely do their best!
