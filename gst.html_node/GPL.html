<h4 class="subsection">1.5.1 Complying with the <span class="sc">gnu</span> <acronym>GPL</acronym></h4>

<p>The <acronym>GPL</acronym> licensing of the virtual machine means that all
derivatives of the virtual machine must be put under the same license. 
In other words, it is strictly forbidden to distribute programs that include the
<span class="sc">gnu</span> Smalltalk virtual machine under a license that is not the GPL. 
This also includes any bindings to external libraries.  For example,
the bindings to Gtk+ are released under the <acronym>GPL</acronym>.

   <p>In principle, the <acronym>GPL</acronym> would not extend to Smalltalk programs,
since these are merely input data for the virtual machine.  On the
other hand, using bindings that are under the <acronym>GPL</acronym> via dynamic
linking would constitute combining two parts (the Smalltalk program and
the bindings) into one program.  Therefore, we added a special exception
to the <acronym>GPL</acronym> in order to avoid gray areas that could adversely
hit both the project and its users:

   <blockquote>
In addition, as a special exception, the Free Software Foundation
give you permission to combine <span class="sc">gnu</span> Smalltalk with free software
programs or libraries that are released under the <span class="sc">gnu</span> <acronym>LGPL</acronym> and with
independent programs running under the <span class="sc">gnu</span> Smalltalk virtual machine.

        <p>You may copy and distribute such a system following the terms of the
<span class="sc">gnu</span> <acronym>GPL</acronym> for <span class="sc">gnu</span> Smalltalk and the licenses of the other code
concerned, provided that you include the source code of that other
code when and as the <span class="sc">gnu</span> <acronym>GPL</acronym> requires distribution of source code.

        <p>Note that people who make modified versions of <span class="sc">gnu</span> Smalltalk are not
obligated to grant this special exception for their modified
versions; it is their choice whether to do so.  The <span class="sc">gnu</span> General
Public License gives permission to release a modified version without
this exception; this exception also makes it possible to release a
modified version which carries forward this exception.
