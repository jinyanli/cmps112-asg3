<h2 class="unnumbered">Introduction</h2>

<p><span class="sc">gnu</span> Smalltalk is an implementation that closely follows the Smalltalk-80
language as described in the book <cite>Smalltalk-80: the Language
and its Implementation</cite> by Adele Goldberg and David Robson, which
will hereinafter be referred to as <cite>the Blue Book</cite>.

   <p>The Smalltalk programming language is an object oriented programming
language.  This means, for one thing, that when programming you are
thinking of not only the data that an object contains, but also of the
operations available on that object.  The object's data representation
capabilities and the operations available on the object are
&ldquo;inseparable&rdquo;; the set of things that you can do with an object is defined
precisely by the set of operations, which Smalltalk calls <dfn>methods</dfn>,
that are available for that object: each object belongs to a <dfn>class</dfn>
(a datatype and the set of functions that operate on it) or, better, it
is an <dfn>instance</dfn> of that class. You cannot even examine the
contents of an object from the outside&mdash;to an outsider, the object is a
black box that has some state and some operations available, but that's
all you know: when you want to perform an operation on an object, you
can only send it a <dfn>message</dfn>, and the object picks up the method
that corresponds to that message.

   <p>In the Smalltalk language, everything is an object.  This includes not
only numbers and all data structures, but even classes, methods,
pieces of code within a method (<dfn>blocks</dfn> or <dfn>closures</dfn>), stack
frames (<dfn>contexts</dfn>), etc.  Even <code>if</code> and <code>while</code> structures
are implemented as methods sent to particular objects.

   <p>Unlike other Smalltalks (including Smalltalk-80), <span class="sc">gnu</span> Smalltalk emphasizes
Smalltalk's rapid prototyping features rather than the graphical and
easy-to-use nature of the programming environment (did you know that the
first GUIs ever ran under Smalltalk?).  The availability of a large body of
system classes, once you master them, makes it pretty easy to write complex
programs which are usually a task for the so called <dfn>scripting
languages</dfn>.  Therefore, even though we have a nice GUI environment including
a class browser (see <a href="Blox.html#Blox">Blox</a>), the goal of the <span class="sc">gnu</span> Smalltalk project is
currently to produce a complete system to be used to write your scripts in a
clear, aesthetically pleasing, and philosophically appealing programming
language.

   <p>An example of what can be obtained with Smalltalk in this novel way can be
found in <a href="../gst-libs/index.html#Top">Class reference</a>.  That part of the manual is entirely generated by a Smalltalk
program, starting from the source code for the class libraries
distributed together with the system.
