<h4 class="subsection">6.1.3 What actually happened</h4>

<p>The front-line Smalltalk interpreter gathers all text
until a '!' character and executes it.  So the actual
Smalltalk code executed was:
<pre class="example">        'Hello, world' printNl
</pre>
   <p>This code does two things.  First, it creates an object of
type <code>String</code> which contains the characters &ldquo;Hello, world&rdquo;. 
Second, it sends the message named <code>printNl</code> to the object. 
When the object is done processing the message, the code is
done and we get our prompt back. 
You'll notice that we didn't say anything about printing
ing the string, even though that's in fact what happened. 
This was very much on purpose: the code we typed in doesn't
know anything about printing strings.  It knew how to get a
string object, and it knew how to send a message to that
object.  That's the end of the story for the code we wrote.

   <p>But for fun, let's take a look at what happened when the
string object received the <code>printNl</code> message.  The string object
then went to a table <a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>
which lists the messages which strings can receive, and what code to
execute.  It found that there is indeed an entry for
<code>printNl</code> in that table and ran this code.  This code then walked through
its characters, printing each of them out to the terminal.  <a rel="footnote" href="#fn-2" name="fnd-2"><sup>2</sup></a>

   <p>The central point is that an object is entirely self-contained;
only the object knew how to print itself out.  When we want an
object to print out, we ask the object itself to do the printing.

   <div class="footnote">
<hr>
<h4>Footnotes</h4><p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-1" href="#fnd-1">1</a>]</small> Which table?  This is determined by the type
of the object.  An object has a type, known as the
class to which it belongs.  Each class has a table
of methods.  For the object we created, it is
known as a member of the <code>String</code> class.  So we go
to the table associated with the String class.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-2" href="#fnd-2">2</a>]</small> 
Actually, the message <code>printNl</code> was inherited
from Object.  It sent a <code>print</code> message, also
inherited by Object, which then sent <code>printOn:</code> to
the object, specifying that it print to the <code>Transcript</code>
object.  The String class then prints its characters to the
standard output.</p>
