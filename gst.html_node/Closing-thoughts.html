<p>You've seen how Smalltalk provides you with some very
powerful data structures.  You've also seen how Smalltalk
itself uses these same facilities to implement the language. 
But this is only the tip of the iceberg&mdash;Smalltalk is much
more than a collection of &ldquo;neat&rdquo; facilities to use. 
The objects and methods which are automatically available
are only the beginning of the foundation on which you
build your programs&mdash;Smalltalk allows you to add your own
objects and methods into the system, and then use them along
with everything else.  The art of programming in Smalltalk
is the art of looking at your problems in terms of objects,
using the existing object types to good effect, and enhancing
Smalltalk with new types of objects.  Now that you've
been exposed to the basics of Smalltalk manipulation, we can
begin to look at this object-oriented technique of programming.
