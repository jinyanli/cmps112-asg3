<h4 class="subsection">6.9.1 The Existing Class Hierarchy</h4>

<p>To discuss where a new class might go, it is helpful to
have a map of the current classes.  The following is the
basic class hierarchy of <span class="sc">gnu</span> Smalltalk.  Indentation means
that the line inherits from the earlier line with one less
level of indentation.<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>.

   <p>While initially a daunting list, you should take the
time to hunt down the classes we've examined in this tutorial
so far.  Notice, for instance, how an Array is a subclass
below the <i>SequenceableCollection</i> class.  This makes sense;
you can walk an Array from one end to the other.  By contrast,
notice how this is not true for Sets: it doesn't make sense
to walk a Set from one end to the other.

   <p>A little puzzling is the relationship of a Bag to a Set, since
a Bag is actually a Set supporting multiple occurrences of its
elements.  The answer lies in the purpose of both a Set and a
Bag.  Both hold an unordered collection of objects; but a Bag
needs to be optimized for the case when an object has possibly
thousands of occurrences, while a Set is optimized for checking
object uniqueness.  That's why Set being a subclass or Bag, or
the other way round, would be a source of problems in the actual
implementation of the class.  Currently a Bag holds a Dictionary
associating each object to each count; it would be feasible however
to have Bag as a subclass of HashedCollection and a sibling of Set.

   <p>Look at the treatment of numbers&mdash;starting with the class
<i>Magnitude</i>.  While numbers can indeed be ordered by <em>less than</em>,
<em>greater than</em>, and so forth, so can a number of other
objects.  Each subclass of Magnitude is such an
object.  So we can compare characters with other characters,
dates with other dates, and times with other times, as well
as numbers with numbers.

   <p>Finally, you will have probably noted some pretty strange classes,
representing language entities that you might have never thought
of as objects themselves: <i>Namespace</i>, <i>Class</i> and even
<i>CompiledMethod</i>.  They are the base of Smalltalk's &ldquo;reflection&rdquo;
mechanism which will be discussed later, in <a href="Why-is-_0023new-there_003f_0021_003f.html#Why-is-_0023new-there_003f_0021_003f">The truth on metaclasses</a>.
