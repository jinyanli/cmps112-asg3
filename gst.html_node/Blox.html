<h3 class="section">3.1 Blox</h3>

<p>Blox is a GUI building block tool kit.  It is an abstraction on top of
the a platform's native GUI toolkit that is common across all platforms. 
Writing to the Blox interface means your GUI based application will be
portable to any platform where Blox is supported.

   <p>The Blox classes, which reside in the <code>BLOX</code> namespace and are
fully documented in <a href="../gst-libs/BLOX.html#BLOX">Graphical users interfaces with BLOX</a>, act as wrappers around other toolkits,
which constitute the required portability layer; currently the only one
supported is Tcl/Tk but alternative versions of Blox, for example based
on Gtk+ and GNOME, have been considered and might even replace Tcl/Tk
in the future<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>.  Instead of
having to rewrite widgets and support for each platform, Blox simply
asks the other toolkit to do so (currently, it hands valid Tcl code
to a standard Tcl 8.0 environment); the abstraction from the operating
system being used is then extracted out of <span class="sc">gnu</span> Smalltalk.

   <p>Together with the toolkit, there is a browsing system in the
<samp><span class="file">browser</span></samp> directory that will allow the programmer to view the
source code for existing classes, to modify existing classes and methods,
to get detailed information about the classes and methods, and to evaluate
code within the browser.  In addition, some simple debugging tools are
provided.  An Inspector window allows the programmer to graphically
inspect and modify the representation of an object and a walkback
inspector was designed which will display a backtrace when the program
encounters an error.

   <p>The Transcript global object is redirected to print to the
transcript window instead of printing to stdout, and the transcript
window as well as the workspaces, unlike the console read-eval-print
loop, support variables that live across multiple evaluations:

<pre class="example">         a := 2   "Do-it"
         a + 2    "Print-it: 4 will be shown"
</pre>
   <p>This browser evolved from an Xt-based version developed around 1993
written by Brad Diller (<a href="mailto:bdiller@docent.com">bdiller@docent.com</a>). Because of legal
concerns about possible copyright infringement because his initial
implementation used parts of ParcPlace's Model-View-Controller (MVC)
message interface, he and Richard Stallman devised a new window update
scheme which is more flexible and powerful than MVC's dependency
mechanism, and allowed him to purge all the MVC elements from the
implementation.

   <p>The code was then further improved to employ a better class design
(for example, Brad used Dictionaries for classes still to be fleshed
out), to be aesthetically more appealing (taking advantage of the
new Blox text widget, the code browsers were enhanced with
syntax highlighting), and to be more complete (adding multiple &ldquo;views&rdquo;
to the inspector, namespace support and a complete debugger).

   <p>To start the browser you can simply type:

<pre class="example">         gst-blox
</pre>
   <p>This will load any requested packages, then, if all goes well, a
worksheet window with a menu named <dfn>Smalltalk</dfn> will appear in the
top-left corner of the screen.

    in an embryonic state; you can find them in the <code>GTK</code>
    package if you have Gtk+ 2.0 or later installed</p>
