<h3 class="section">3.8 Sockets, WebServer, NetClients</h3>

<p><span class="sc">gnu</span> Smalltalk includes an almost complete abstraction of the <span class="sc">tcp</span>, <span class="sc">udp</span>
and <span class="sc">ip</span> protocols.  Although based on the standard <span class="sc">bsd</span> sockets,
this library provides facilities such as buffering and preemptive I/O
which a C programmer usually has to implement manually.

   <p>The distribution includes a few tests (mostly loopback tests that
demonstrate both client and server connection), which are class methods
in <code>Socket</code>.  This code should guide you in the process of creating
and using both server and client sockets; after creation, sockets behave
practically the same as standard Smalltalk streams, so you should not
have particular problems.  For more information, refer to <a href="../gst-libs/Sockets.html#Sockets">Network programming with Sockets</a>. 
The library is also used by many other packages, including Swazoo
and the MySQL driver.

   <p>There is also code implementing the most popular Internet protocols:
<span class="sc">ftp</span>, <span class="sc">http</span>, <span class="sc">nntp</span>, <span class="sc">smtp</span>, <span class="sc">pop3</span> and <span class="sc">imap</span>. 
These classes, loaded by the <code>NetClients</code> package, are derived
from multiple public domain and free software packages available for
other Smalltalk dialects and ported to <span class="sc">gnu</span> Smalltalk.  Future version of
<span class="sc">gnu</span> Smalltalk will include documentation for these as well.
