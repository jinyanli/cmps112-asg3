<h4 class="subsection">6.1.4 Doing math</h4>

<p>A similar piece of code prints numbers:
<pre class="example">       1234 printNl
</pre>
   <p>Notice how we used the same message, but have sent it to a
new type of object&mdash;an integer (from class <code>Integer</code>).  The
way in which an integer is printed is much different from
the way a string is printed on the inside, but because we
are just sending a message, we do not have to be aware of
this.  We tell it to <code>printNl</code>, and it prints itself out.

   <p>As a user of an object, we can thus usually send a particular
message and expect basically the same kind of behavior,
regardless of object's internal structure (for
instance, we have seen that sending <code>printNl</code> to an object
makes the object print itself).  In later chapters we will
see a wide range of types of objects.  Yet all of them can
be printed out the same way&mdash;with <code>printNl</code>.

   <p>White space is ignored, except as it separates words. 
This example could also have looked like:
<pre class="example">                   1234 printNl
</pre>
   <p>However, <span class="sc">gnu</span> Smalltalk tries to execute each line by itself if
possible.  If you wanted to write the code on two lines, you
might have written something like:
<pre class="example">     (1234
         printNl)
</pre>
   <p>From now on, we'll omit <code>printNl</code> since <span class="sc">gnu</span> Smalltalk
does the service of printing the answer for us.

   <p>An integer can be sent a number of messages in addition
to just printing itself.  An important set of messages for
integers are the ones which do math:

<pre class="example">        9 + 7
</pre>
   <p>Answers (correctly!) the value 16.  The way that it does
this, however, is a significant departure from a procedural
language.
