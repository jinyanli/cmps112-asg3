<h3 class="section">5.6 Smalltalk blocks as C function pointers</h3>

<p>The Smalltalk callin mechanism can be used effectively to construct
bindings to C libraries that require callbacks into Smalltalk. 
However, it is a &ldquo;static&rdquo; mechanism, as the callback functions
passed to the libraries have to be written in C and their type
signatures are fixed.

   <p>If the signatures of the callbacks are not known in advance,
and the only way to define callbacks is via C function pointers (as
opposed to reflective mechanisms such as the ones in GTK+), then
the <code>VMProxy</code> functions for Smalltalk callin are not enough.

   <p><span class="sc">gnu</span> Smalltalk provides a more dynamic way to convert Smalltalk blocks into
C function pointers through the <code>CCallbackDescriptor</code> class. 
This class has a constructor method that is similar to the
<code>cCall:</code> annotation used for callouts.  The method is
called <code>for:returning:withArgs:</code> and its parameters are:

     <ul>
<li>a block, whose number of arguments is variable
<li>a symbol representing the return type
<li>an array representing the type of the arguments. 
</ul>

   <p>The array passed as the third parameter represents values that
are passed <em>from C to Smalltalk</em> and, as such, should be
filled with the same rules that are used by the <em>return
  type</em> of a C callout.  In particular, if the C callback
accepts an <code>int *</code> it is possible (and indeed useful)
to specify the type of the argument as <code>#{CInt}</code>,
so that the block will receive a <code>CInt</code> object.

   <p>Here is an example of creating a callback which is passed to
<code>glutReshapeFunc</code><a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>.  The desired
signature in C is <code>void (*) (int, int)</code>.
<pre class="example">     | glut |
     <span class="roman">...</span>
     glut glutReshapeFunc: (CCallbackDescriptor
         for: [ :x :y | self reshape: x@y ]
         returning: #void
         withArgs: #(#int #int))
</pre>
   <p>It is important to note that this kind of callback does not survive
across an image load (this restriction may be lifted in a future version). 
When the image is loaded, it has to be reset by sending it the <code>link</code>
message before it is passed to any C function.  Sending the <code>link</code>
message to an already valid callback is harmless and cheap.
