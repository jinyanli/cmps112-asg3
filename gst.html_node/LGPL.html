<h4 class="subsection">1.5.2 Complying with the <span class="sc">gnu</span> <acronym>LGPL</acronym></h4>

<p>Smalltalk programs that run under <span class="sc">gnu</span> Smalltalk are linked with the system
classes in <span class="sc">gnu</span> Smalltalk class library.  Therefore, they must respect the terms
of the Lesser General Public License<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>.

   <p>The interpretation of this license for architectures different from
that of the C language is often difficult; the accepted one for
Smalltalk is as follows.  The image file can be considered as an
object file, falling under Subsection 6a of the license, as long as
it allows a user to load an image, upgrade the library or otherwise
apply modifications to it, and save a modified image: this is most
conveniently obtained by allowing the user to use the read-eval-print
loop that is embedded in the <span class="sc">gnu</span> Smalltalk virtual machine.

   <p>In other words, provided that you leave access to the loop in a
documented way, or that you provide a way to file in arbitrary files
in an image and save the result to a new image, you are obeying
Subsection 6a of the Lesser General Public License, which is
reported here:

   <blockquote>
a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
to use the modified definitions.) 
</blockquote>

   <p>In the future, alternative mechanisms similar to shared libraries may
be provided, so that it is possible to comply with the <span class="sc">gnu</span> <acronym>LGPL</acronym>
in other ways.
